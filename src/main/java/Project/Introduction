Hi , Good Morning Everyone

i am Deepak Kumar Singh and I was born and brought up in Bihar,
where I completed my high school education. After that, I moved to Bhopal for my
higher education ,where I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science in 2019

I have over 4.5 years of experience in Java development and production support,
where I’ve honed my skills in designing and optimizing applications, troubleshooting issues,
and maintaining production systems.
 My career began at Amazon in 2020 feb , where I worked as a Support Engineer
 I on the Amazon Appstore, a platform similar to the Google Play Store. In this role,
  I focused on providing technical support, resolving complex issues, and
  creating knowledge base (KB) documents to streamline troubleshooting processes.

After two years, I joined  to TCS in 2022 feb as a System Engineer, where I had the
 opportunity to work in the banking domain. Here, I was primarily responsible for
 developing new features, troubleshooting application issues, and updating
 KB documents to enhance team efficiency.

Most recently, I joined Apexon in August this year, where I am excited to further
expand my skills and explore new challenges in the tech space

In my free time, I enjoy traveling to new places to experience different cultures
and cuisines.
I also love cooking, experimenting with new recipes

My parents have always been my biggest role models, and I’ve learned a lot from their
dedication and commitment.

I’m looking forward to the opportunities ahead and am eager to contribute to the
success of the team.
